## ArnimFox (Tested on Windows only)

Gonna mess this up but still have been a decade long user of firefox and always thrived for having vertical tabs. Though it's very much achievable by adding extensions but still it very much lacks the continuity. Though a novice developer, tried my best making a stylesheet to customize it to my preference. 


## Installation

Step 1: Go to the page `about:config` in your browser and change the following settings:

    toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets => True
    
Step 2: Download the code files as a zip or clone it using git

Step 2: Hit up `about:profiles` page and locate the root directory of your default profile

Step 3: Create `chrome` folder inside this directory and paste the code file (exclude the screenshots folder)

## Add-ons 
 • Get [SideBery](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sidebery/) if you don't have it already installed 
 
 • Go to Sidebery settings and paste the content of my `sidebery.css` file into Styles editor > Sidebar

 • Configure the Apperance to the settings as mentioned in settings.png in screnshots folder (not must but recommended)

## Some Concerns
While I have tried my best, it is bound to still encounter bugs at some point. Though a novice developer, I will try to address them to the best of my capabilities. Thanks for all the co-operation
